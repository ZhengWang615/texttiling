 the data points are independent. Independence means that the position of one data point does not influence the position of the next data point, that is, data are not auto-correlated. If the process shifts, these conditions are no longer true and patterns of non-random variation may be detected by statistical tests.

Carbohydrates in form of nectar sugars constitute the main energy source for adult bees , . Most bees ingest nectar by lapping, with the maximal energy intake rate being achieved for sugar concentrations of around 5060% , . Lower and higher concentrations can be imbibed as well, and it has been shown in honey bees that nectar throughput through the proventriculus is adjusted to the nectar sugar concentration and the metabolic rate, with lower concentrations receiving a relatively higher throughput and vice versa . Though this mechanism ensures a consistent energy supply independent of the concentrations of imbibed solutions, honey bees and other bees usually prefer the higher concentrated nectar if given a choice (honey bees ; euglossine bees ; bumble bees ). A high sugar to water ratio of crop content means that the carried weight has more energetic value, which would allow the bees to remain active and airborne for longer periods of time without having to refuel at nectar sources. This could be especially beneficial for activities that require high energy expenditure (flying/hovering) over reasonably long periods of time, when either access to flowers is not possible, or the time is required for other behaviors (discussed in e.g. ) This can be envisioned to apply in the context of mate-finding, e.g. during mating flights in carpenter bees  or bumble bees , where males stay airborne for long periods of time, or when defending a territory (see  ). Other situations in which bees should benefit from energetically rich crop contents are fast long range movements and when female bees forage for pollen at plants that do not provide nectar (see ).

SUB-TOPIC1

Some bees have been reported to achieve energetically more favorable sugar concentrations of crop content by evaporating water from regurgitated droplets of nectar. They extend the proboscis with a droplet of regurgitated nectar visible either around the mandibles, the outstretched galeae or at the tip of the proboscis with the glossa protruding into it. Often either the glossa or the proboscis is moved, and the droplet is re-ingested and regurgitated repeatedly (nectar dehydration or bubbling; honey bees ; carpenter bees , , ; bumble bees ; stingless bees ; allodapine bees ; colletid bees ; halictine bees ).

Euglossine bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini), important Neotropical pollinators of a variety of plants , are characterized by their very long proboscides , which allow them to exploit flowers with long tubes in addition to other flower types , . In contrast to other bees, however, the orchid bees employ suction feeding for nectar ingestion . As viscosity rises exponentially with the sugar concentration , , the suction feeding style is constrained by nectar concentration. This is visible in the fact that the optimal energy intake rate is achieved for approximately 1020% lower sugar concentrations (3040%) compared to the lapping style (; reviewed by ). Accordingly, such more dilute nectars are often found in plants with deeply corollated flowers visited by orchid bees (; and see ,  on crop samples of orchid bees). Orchid bees are nevertheless strong flyers, easily capable of rapid flight and covering long distances (23 km in one day ; 45 km within two days and distances of up to 95 km ). Males can be observed collecting volatile components for pheromone analogs (see , , , ), showing territorial display behavior and engaging in territorial contests with other males continuously for long durations of time (contests can last up to over an hour ; D. W. Roubik, pers. comm.; T. Pokorny, pers. obs.). The importance of sugar concentration for maintaining high metabolic activity raises the question on how orchid bees manage to overcome the constraint of suction feeding in order to cover their energy expenditure on predominantly dilute nectars. A higher throughput of nectar seems improbable to be the only factor accountable for such demanding flight accomplishments, especially in the light of the long timespans without visits to nectar sources (>1 h, see : contest duration; : odor collection). Nectar dehydration in the same manner as employed by other bees is rather unlikely. First, the euglossine proboscis is too long for such a procedure, as it reaches at least sternum I when held under the body and can in some cases even reach beyond the tip of the metasoma . Stretching the proboscis out with the droplet at the tip or around the whole proboscis, as described for other bees, therefore seems improbable. Second, reuptake of highly concentrated nectar droplets from the tip of the proboscis would likely be constrained by the increased viscosity of the dehydrated nectar (see ). Nevertheless, nectar water evaporation might be achieved by comparable means. In cage settings, male and female  spp. can be seen showing a conspicuous behavior reminiscent of that of nectar dehydration in other bees, which will henceforth be called tongue flicking. Tongue flicking in orchid bees differs from evaporation behaviors described for other bees in that the proboscis stays located beneath the bees body, and the regurgitated liquid is stretched out as a thin film between the different proximal parts of the proboscis. In this study we assessed whether the tongue flicking behavior serves to evaporate water from crop content for males of two sympatric species of  ( and ) that differ in size (13 mm/10 mm) and proboscis length (extended 16 mm/18.7 mm, see ).

Sugar concentration does not only have an impact on the adults energy budget, but plays an important role in brood provisions as well (reviewed in ). All solitary and most eusocial bees (excepting honey bees) mass provision their brood cells, sealing them after the egg has been laid. Provisions commonly consist of pollen with more or less added nectar , , , . The added nectar constitutes up to 99% of the sugar content of provisions , and higher sugar contents in larval provisions have been shown to positively influence the resulting larval weight , . Higher larval weight was discussed as potential factor increasing adult mass and fecundity . Based on this, we investigated whether female  orchid bees have behavioral adaptations relating to the manipulation of sugar concentrations of brood provisions. Here, we focused on  and , two species that readily accept trap nests and thus can be obtained for observation.

A run is defined as a sequence of like items that is preceded and followed by one or more items of another type or by none at all. Items can be plus and minus signs, heads and tails, odd and even numbers, and numbers above and below a certain value, for example the median. Runs analysis are useful for such different purposes as digital image analysis, looking for extra-terrestrial intelligence, testing for roulette fraud and serial correlation among residuals in a regression analysis  and for detection of shifts in health care processes. Runs analysis makes no assumptions on the theoretical distribution of data.
=======
Experiments on nectar dehydration were conducted during May 2013 at the Tropical Station La Gamba, Puntarenas, Costa Rica. We used male bees as they can easily be captured in sufficient numbers and cannot sting, facilitating handling and thus minimizing handling time (Field work permission granted by the Ministerio del Ambiente y Energa, Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacin, Costa Rica). Male  and , like many euglossine males, can be easily attracted to scent baits where they were captured using hand nets and transferred into Eppendorf vials with breathing holes. After return to the field station, they were individually marked with Opalithplttchen (Graze, Germany) of different colors and shapes and released together into a mesh cage (454545 cm) outfitted with perching opportunities (branches with leaves) and feeders in the shape of artificial flowers (see ), the latter of which were removed each evening to avoid fermentation. They were trained to take sugar-water (sucrose dissolved in water, 30%w/w) from the artificial flowers over the course of three to five days. The experiments began when all remaining bees (: n = 10; : n = 12) were sufficiently familiar with the cage situation and could be expected to show normal behavior (i.e. not constantly flying against the mesh walls searching for a way out and not spending hours trying to pry the Opalithplttchen off the mesosoma). At 0510 hours, before first morning activity, artificial flowers were placed in the cage. All flowers contained the same concentration of sugar-water solution. Observation began with first drinking activity between 0525 and 0535 hours and lasted five hours. The duration (in minutes) of time spent drinking and that spent tongue flicking was noted for each individual. After the observation period each bee was captured, and a sample of its crop content was obtained by gently squeezing the metasoma and taking up the regurgitated droplet using glass microcapillaries (2 l). Bees were immediately released back into the cage where they were allowed to feed freely for the rest of the day. Samples of crop content were diluted by four with distilled water in order to obtain a sufficient amount of liquid to be measured with a handheld refractometer (Mller, Germany) corrected for temperature. Resulting values were corrected for the dilution. Six different sugar concentrations lying within the possible feeding range of orchid bees were offered on consecutive days in the following order: 40.8%30.0%34.6%45.2%25.0% and 50.0% sugar (order determined randomly with the restriction that the lowest and highest sugar solution would be tested last). Each sugar solution was freshly prepared on the respective morning, and measured for its sugar concentration using the handheld refractometer prior to filling the artificial flowers with the mixture. Concentrations deviated from the targeted 5%-steps (three cases, 40.8 instead of 40%, 34.6 instead of 35% and 45.2 instead of 45%) when adjustment of sugar concentration was not accomplished in time before the feeders had to be exposed. All ten  and twelve  were tested on each of the different concentrations. Additionally, samples from the artificial flowers were taken in the evenings to monitor evaporative water loss from the provided sugar-water.

The  was originally proposed by Swed and Eisenhart for testing the randomness of a sequence . If the number of runs is too small or too large, it is an indication that the sequence is not random, e.g. positively or negatively autocorrelated. Especially, if the number is too small it will indicate that the process centre may be shifting. To do the runs test one must either do some rather complicated calculations or look up the limits for the expected number of runs in tables based on the total number of runs in the sequence and the number of items of each kind. Simplified tables for use with run charts have been developed for run charts up to 60 data points , . For more than 60 data points, the limits can be calculated using the normal approximation of the runs distribution function .

Female  and  reared from trap nests were observed during the autumn months of 2012 in a large flight cage (8.83.32.8 m) kept under greenhouse conditions in Dsseldorf, Germany. The bees could feed ad libitum from artificial flowers filled with sugar solution (3036%) which was exchanged daily. ,  and  were offered as pollen sources, as preliminary tests had shown their suitability as pollen sources for these bees. Additionally, hardwood nest boxes (5.510.03.3 cm) and stingless bee cerumen were provided for nest construction. Pollen manipulation outside of the nest boxes was documented on several occasions. When possible, samples of freshly deposited pollen loads were obtained for analysis of sugar concentration. Samples were weighed, diluted with demineralized water and mixed using a vortex (Reax Top, Heidolph, Germany) in order to solubilize the contained sugar. When all of the pollen was suspended in the water, the samples were centrifuged (Micro 20, Hettich, Switzerland, 13000 rpm for 10 minutes), and the sugar content of the supernatant was measured using a handheld refractometer (Krss Optronic, Germany). Resulting values were corrected for the dilution.

Chen has proposed an alternative way of performing the runs test . Instead of looking at the number of runs, Chen suggests to look at the number of shifts (crossings) in the sequence. In a run chart crossings are easily counted by counting the number of times the graph crosses the median line. The number of crossings in a random sequence will follow a binomial distribution with success probability of 0.5. Thus, the lower 5% prediction value for number of crossings is the lower 5th percentile from the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution with a success probability of 0.5 and n  1 trials where n is the number of useful observations, that is, observations that do not fall on the median. The lower limit can be looked up in a statistical table or calculated using a spreadsheet or statistical software. For example, with a run chart of 20 data points,  than 6 crossings would indicate that the process is shifting.
=======
We tested whether sugar concentration differed between the offered solution and crop samples after tongue flicking as well as between offered solution and the liquid part of brood provisions after pollen manipulation using Wilcoxon signed rank tests for paired data. Welch two sample t-tests served to compare the average differences between initial and resulting sugar concentration with or without tongue flicking, and correlation of tongue flicking time with resulting sugar concentration of crop content as well as correlation of initial concentration with tongue flicking time were analyzed with Spearman rank correlations. All tests were performed in R v.3.0.2 .

Tongue flicking: After feeding from the artificial flowers, the bees commonly withdrew to secluded places in the cage, where they perched nearly motionless with the proximal part of the proboscis split into galeae, glossa and labial palps, drawing a fluid film between them (). Additionally, a large drop of liquid was often visible around the mandibles and the upper part of the proboscis, which was moved back and forth rhythmically (see ).

Another widely used test for non-random variation in run charts is the . A shift is an unusually long run of consecutive data points either above or below the median. Data points that fall on the median are not counted, that is they do not contribute to the run, nor do they break it. The cut-off value to define unusually long varies in the literature. Perla defines a shift as six or more consecutive data points on the same side on the median , while Carey and others recommend seven or eight data points depending on the purpose of the run chart and the total number of data points available .
=======
Application of sugar-water to the pollen load: In the course of pollen collection and manipulation, female bees added regurgitated droplets to their corbiculae by extending the proboscis and positioning both front basitarsi on either side, moving them down along the proboscis. When the front legs were about a third of the way down, a droplet would start to appear at the tip of it. The droplet would eventually be swiped off the tip of the proboscis with the front tarsi. Subsequently, this droplet was taken up from there by the middle tarsi, which were positioned on the hind basitarsi and then moved upward onto the corbiculae, thus eventually transferring the droplet to the pollen load (see ). Additional patting movements of the middle legs on the pollen load could be observed after wiping the front tarsi off a second time (see ).

The shift test is based on the theory of long runs. Schilling showed that the expected length of the longest run in a sequence depends on the total number of elements in the sequence and is predictable within limits . The expected length of the longest run either above or below the median is , where n is the total number of data points not on the median (useful observations). Approximately 95% of the longest runs are predicted to be within +/ 3 of the expected value. For the purpose of detecting a change in process position, a shift, we are interested in the upper prediction limit. The upper prediction limit for longest run is  rounded to the nearest integer. For example, if one has a run chart of 20 data points, the expected longest run would be 4, and a run of  than 7 data points would indicate a shift in process level.
=======
Kneading: After having filled their corbiculae, the females withdrew to a secluded perch, mostly positioned near the top of the cage, where they attached themselves beneath or on the side of a leaf by their mandibles. Due to this, observation never included the first few seconds of the further pollen manipulation process. For pollen manipulation, kneading, the females took up a characteristic posture () with the moistened pollen spread across the ventral side of the metasoma, the corbiculae and the ventral side of the middle legs. Sometimes small amounts of nectar-pollen mixture would also be present on the front legs. The middle legs were held up at a right angle to the body with the tarsi facing forward for most of the time. The hind legs made up-and-down pumping motions, moving the basitarsi together and away from each other in elliptical paths. In regular intervals the middle legs were brought down onto the pollen mass, patting and kneading it, and then lifted up into position again. All the while the front legs were held motionless beside the head (see ). Occasionally more droplets of liquid were added to the mass. In the end, the pollen was groomed off the bees body and transferred back to the corbiculae, forming smooth, shiny pollen loads. The whole process from end of pollen collection until entering the nest with the manipulated pollen loads took on average 24 minutes (n =  ten observations, SD = 9 minutes).

The  is also commonly used. A trend is an unusually long run of data points all going up or down. Conceptually, a trend is merely a special form of a run, where like items are defined as data points that are bigger or smaller than the preceding one. The trend test was developed by Olmstead who provided tables and formulas for the probabilities of trends of different lengths depending on the total number of data points . For example, with less than 27 data points in total, the chance of having a trend of 6 or more data points going up or down is less than 5%. Note that Olmstead defines a trend as the number of jumps rather than the number of data points that surround the jumps (which, of cause, is one more than the number of jumps).

Male (Costa Rica and Germany Greenhouse) as well as female (Germany Greenhouse)  spp. showed the tongue flicking behavior. Each of the male bees in Costa Rica did so on at least two of the six days they were observed. There were no obvious differences between the two species regarding results on nectar evaporation despite the differences in body size and relative proboscis length. They spent between 0 and 234/245 minutes ( and , respectively, see ) of the 300 minute observation period showing tongue flicking behavior. There was no correlation between the offered sugar concentration and the duration of the tongue flicking behavior (Spearman rank correlation, :  = 0.3068, rho  = 0.1341; :  = 0.9007, rho  = 0.0149, ). Resulting crop sugar concentrations were always higher than those that had been offered in the artificial flowers (one exception, see ), with a significant change in sugar concentration after tongue flicking for all tested concentrations and both species (Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data, <0.05, see ). The sugar concentration of crop contents reached values as high as 72.6% for  and 75.6% for , up to 34.8% higher than the originally imbibed concentration. Average values for resulting sugar concentrations of crop contents were lower due to a general variability in duration and efficiency of tongue flicking behavior, and some individuals did not show tongue flicking behavior at all on some of the days (see ), but remained generally inactive, spending most of the observation time hanging by their mandibles from leaves or the mesh walls in a torpor-like state. In cases in which individuals had not engaged in tongue flicking behavior, crop content concentration was on average 6.8% (, n = 5 cases, SD: 2.0%) and 4.8% (, n = 17 cases, SD: 4.5%) higher than the respective feeder sugar concentration. This was however significantly lower than the average concentration difference of crop content to offered sugar-water in all cases in which tongue flicking occurred (14.9%, SD: 6.8%, and 19.5%, SD: 9.5%; Welch two sample t-test: , t = 6.2966, df = 15, <0.001; , t = 8.7303, df = 58, <0.001). Additionally, duration of tongue flicking behavior and resulting concentration were positively correlated (, ) in all but one case (30% initial concentration for , Spearman rank correlation,  = 0.1909, see ). Evaporative water loss from the artificial feeders during the respective days led to values maximally 1% higher than the sugar concentration measured in the morning (), and could therefore not have been responsible for the higher concentrations found in the crop contents.

Although the trend rule has been shown to be ineffective , it is still widely used in health care.

Female  and  that accepted the provided nest boxes would set out to build cells with the offered cerumen, after which they started foraging for pollen. Pollen collection by buzzing usually was one of the first female activities in the morning (around 0600 hours, while most male bees were still inactive), sometimes preceded by a short visit to the artificial flowers. All offered pollen plants were visited, with occasional nectaring trips to the artificial flowers during pollen foraging trips. Sugar-water was regularly applied to the pollen load on the corbiculae. We could obtain freshly deposited pollen loads from four female  (from one, three, three and four brood cells for each of the respective females) and two  (from one and two cells, see ). Samples of different brood cells from the same individuals were treated as independent samples since the variation of sugar concentration within the nest of one female was as high or higher as that found in samples from different females. Sugar concentration of the freshly deposited pollen loads (n = 14) was significantly higher than that provided in the artificial flowers (Wilcoxon signed rank test, <0.001, see . Measurements of sugar concentration were taken later in the day than collection of pollen samples in order to take potential evaporation from the artificial flowers into account). Sugar concentration of pollen loads was on average 69.59% (SD: 2.98%).

In addition to the above mentioned rules, it is recommended also to look for other unnatural patterns in data that may indicate the presence of non-random variation. These patterns may include cyclic behaviour or obviously different data points.
=======
In this study we describe a behavior of euglossine bees dubbed tongue flicking, which differs from the nectar dehydration practiced by other bees. Nectar is not exposed at the tip but at the base of the proboscis, involving rhythmic movements of a fluid film stretched out between the proximal parts of the proboscis, which are held spread apart for this purpose. Exposing the regurgitated droplets at the base of the proboscis and the splitting of the suction canal into its parallel parts likely circumvents viscosity constraints that would otherwise impede nectar dehydration in these extremely long-tongued bees. The behavior led to higher sugar concentrations of crop content (reaching values up to over 70%, similar to maximal values reported by Wittmann and Scholz  for male , 66.1% sugar), with the tongue flicking duration being positively correlated to the resulting sugar concentration. The maximal difference between initial and resulting sugar concentration might be overestimated to a small degree, as bees that had not shown tongue flicking behavior nevertheless had slightly higher crop sugar concentrations than what was offered. This could be due to a mixing of the imbibed sugar-water with the residual, concentrated crop content from the previous evening (the crop lining is almost impermeable ). Male bumble bees have been shown to exhibit long flights before nectar uptake in the mornings, which was most probably fueled by such residual sugar reserves . Orchid bee tongue flicking duration was not adjusted to the sugar concentration offered in the feeders, which, together with the fact that all observed individuals showed the behavior on at least two of six days, suggests that the behavior is generally shown after feeding (bees that did not engage in tongue flicking were overall inactive). We are unaware of other long-tongued bees employing similar behaviors.

Another behavior which was practiced exclusively by female euglossine bees was the manipulation of mixed nectar-pollen provisions, dubbed kneading. Pollen foraging cannot be preceded by hour-long nectar dehydration as pollen sources are often depleted quickly following anthesis in the early morning (see review ). Additionally, the bees, owing to the long proboscides, cannot regurgitate dehydrated crop content onto pollen loads already positioned in the brood cell, as some short tongued bees do (see e.g. ). Instead, female euglossine bees visit nectar flowers during pollen collection trips, and add regurgitated nectar to the pollen loads while hovering, without having displayed the tongue flicking behavior before. Sugar concentration of orchid bee pollen loads nevertheless reached values which were nearly twice as high as the sugar-water offered to the bees. We propose that the extensive manipulation of pollen loads, kneading, shown before deposition in the brood cells is the main factor responsible for the rise in sugar concentration. All aspects shown in this behavior, creating a large surface by spreading the pollen loads across the whole ventral surface and four legs, moving and kneading the mass while continuously adding more nectar to it without resulting provisions being rendered extremely fluid, suggest evaporative water loss during the process. This in consequence entails a rise in relative sugar content. Though soluble sugars originating from the pollen surface itself have been documented for some plant species, they usually constitute only a small proportion of pollen weight . Supporting our conclusions, honey bee collected pollen (mixed with regurgitated nectar) has a higher sugar content than hand collected pollen , , and a study on pollen provisions of  and alfalfa pollen  showed that the sugar originating from the pollen itself constituted less than 1% of the total sugar content of the provisions. Dissolved amino acids from the pollen might lead to overestimation of sugar content of the measured pollen provisions since the refractive index is based on all dissolved solids in a solution (see ). However, duration of pollen-water-contact was kept short (less than 15 minutes; extraction times for analyses of total amounts of water-soluble amino acids are much longer, see ) and if overestimation occurred despite this, it was likely only slight (see , ).

Being able to raise the sugar concentration and thus energy content of aliments after first ingestion in addition to other mechanisms like nectar throughput seems especially important for suction feeding bees that face the problem of having to ingest nectar of suboptimal/low sugar concentrations. Borrell  has argued that suction feeding might have been a consequence of longer proboscides, since anatomical constraints might render suction feeding more effective than lapping in such cases despite the constraint on viscosity, and this derived feeding mode seems to have evolved multiple times for flower-visiting insects with extremely long mouthparts like e.g. butterflies and moths (see  in ).

However, the long proboscides enable the euglossine bees to exploit a greater variety of nectar sources, which might be highly advantageous in the Neotropical environment, where stingless bees, through recruitment and sheer numbers, can dominate (and deplete) many abundant resources , . Being able to shift to flowers whose nectar is not easily accessible to short-tongued stingless bees could have evolved to evade the competition. Such a partitioning has been suggested to occur even between some meliponine bees.  has a considerably longer proboscis than , and was constant to flowers with deeper corolla tubes but significantly lower nectar concentrations (21%) rather than competing with the latter species for flowers in the same locality that offered higher concentrated but easily accessible nectar rewards (60% ). It seems to be a common phenomenon that plants with deep floral morphologies tend to provide more dilute nectars. Plowright  argued that the dilute nectars might simply be a consequence of the deep corolla tubes, since the secreted nectar is protected from evaporation, and other studies support the effect of microclimatic protection on nectar concentration , . Though it seems that long-tongued insects exploiting nectar resources from deep tubes face no disadvantage concerning the suction feeding constraint on viscosity as the nectar provided is relatively dilute, lower sugar concentrations for optimal energy intake rate could be expected to limit the efficiency at or the number of alternative nectar sources offering higher concentrations. Both aspects combined would be disadvantageous for highly active organisms if no possibilities to compensate the lower energy uptake were present.

For the study on the effect of shifts in process mean, the program did 1000 simulations of each run chart of length 2 to 100 with samples from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1 and distribution mean of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 respectively. In addition, the run charts with sample mean of zero was analysed with both a fixed median of 0 and with a floating median defined as the actual median of the numbers in the run chart. All other analyses were done with a fixed median of 0.

To study the effect of linear drift in process mean, the program did 1000 simulations of each run chart of length 2 to 100 while introducing an increase of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 respectively in distribution mean between consecutive sample data points.

We studied the following rules for detection of non-random variation:

Shift rule: A shift is present if any run of consecutive data points on the same side of the median is longer than the prediction limit.

SUB-TOPIC18
----------

Crossings rule: A crossings signal is present if the number of times the graph crosses the median is smaller than the prediction limit.

SUB-TOPIC19
----------

Trend rule: A trend is present if the longest run of data points going up or down is longer than the prediction limit.

SUB-TOPIC20
----------

Prediction limits for shifts and crossings in run charts with 10 to 100 data points are tabulated in . A trend was signalled if the p-value calculated using formula 6 in Olmstead's paper was less than 0.05 .

For comparison, we also studied the , which is used with Shewhart control charts. The three-sigma signal is triggered when any data point is further than 3 standard deviations away from the overall process average . Since simulation data were created from a standard normal distribution with a known mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we used +/ 3 as sigma limits.

SUB-TOPIC21
----------

The outcome from each simulation was the proportion of run charts which triggered the rule, that is, the simulated power of the test with respect to detection of the shift under study.

SUB-TOPIC22
----------

shows that when no shift is present in the data, the (false) signal rates for the shift and crossings rules suggested in this paper are approximately 5% and independent of the number of data points in the run chart. The (true) signal rates increase when shifts are introduced in the data. The larger the shift, the quicker the run charts pick up the signal.

SUB-TOPIC23
----------

For example, when a shift in process mean of 1 standard deviation is present, approximately 70% and 60% of run charts with 20 data points will signal the shift and crossings rules respectively. If the shift is more than 1.5 standard deviation, over 90% of run charts with 20 data points detect the change.

SUB-TOPIC24
----------

The shift rule has a slightly higher signal rate with a fixed median compared to a floating median. The difference levels out as the number of data points increases.

SUB-TOPIC25
----------

When combining the shift and crossings rules so that a signal is considered present if either the shift or the crossings rule is triggered, the sensitivity to shifts in data increased at the cost of a slightly elevated false signal rate (results not shown).

The three-sigma rule is less sensitive to shifts up to 2 standard deviations than the shift and crossings rules and shows an increasing false signal rate as the number of data points increases. At 40 data points the false signal rate is around 10%. It should be noted that, in practice, it is common to adjust the sigma limits to the number of data points to achieve a fixed false signal rate.

SUB-TOPIC26
----------

shows that even when a drift of 0.3 standard deviation is added to each sample data point, only about 20% of run charts with 100 data points will signal the trend rule. In contrast, the shift and crossings rules pick up the drift with almost 100% certainty already at 20 data points. Thus, the trend rule is virtually useless for detection of linear drift over time, the purpose it was intended for.

SUB-TOPIC27
----------

This simulation study shows that the suggested shift and crossings rules are effective in detecting moderate to large shifts and drifts in process level over time while keeping the false signal rate constant around 5% and independent of the number of data points in the chart.

The trend rule is performing so poorly compared to the other rules, that we question its appropriateness.

SUB-TOPIC28
----------

To our knowledge, this study is the first to study the performance of run charts under simulated shifts and drift in process mean.

SUB-TOPIC29
----------

Traditionally, the performance of Shewhart control charts is characterized by the average run length (ARL) to signal. ARL is the average number of data points it takes to pick up a change in process level. For practical and didactical reasons we chose to plot signal rates as a function of run chart length as our metric. First, it turned out to be impractical to identify ARL for our run chart rules when no signals were present. Because the prediction limits are dynamically adapted to the number of data points these simulations often entered endless loops creating extremely long data sequences making the simulation programme run for several days without completion. Second, the graphical presentation of signal rates are, in our experience, more intuitively understandable for clinicians without specific statistical training than are ARL's.

SUB-TOPIC30
----------

It may be argued that the simulations used in our study are for a fixed number of observations, while in practice one will apply the run chart rules sequentially, deciding after each data point if non-random variation is present. However, it is our experience from using these rules in practice for several years on real life data that the rules work well in practice and offer good protection against false positive signals and are effective in detecting real change in process performance.

SUB-TOPIC31
----------

The shift rule proposed in this study is more conservative than the shift rules that are usually suggested , , . Perla and Provost suggest using only 6 data points to signal a shift. Carey suggests 7 data points for a run chart with up to 19 data points. The shift rule we suggest takes at least 8 data points to signal a shift if one has between 12 and 22 data points in total. Of course, the choice of cut off value is a trade-off between the need to quickly pick up a signal when the process is changing and the risk of picking up false signals when no change is present. One should be aware that relaxing the rules will result in higher false signal rates.

SUB-TOPIC32
----------

Run charts have several advantages over control charts. First, run charts are easier to construct and teach. Pen and paper is all it takes. Second, run charts make no assumptions about the theoretical distribution of data, which make them especially useful when baseline data are not available to characterise the process prior to a control chart analysis. Third, when using the shift and crossings rules proposed in this study rather than the usual fixed signal limits, the false signal rate is independent of the number of data points. Finally, as our results show, the run chart rules we propose have higher sensitivity and specificity to moderate (~1.5 SD) changes in process performance than the sigma rule alone.

SUB-TOPIC33
----------

As a consequence, we suggest always studying process data with run charts before applying control charts. If a run chart identifies non-random variation, it could mean many things including a lack of independence in the data, which would invalidate the control chart.

SUB-TOPIC34
----------

However, having no control limits, run charts are not capable of determining if any single data point deviates significantly from the rest. Thus run charts will not detect large and transient shifts and may be slower than control charts to detect large (>2 SD) permanent shifts in process mean. Also, run charts are unable to determine if the process is statistically stable . But even if stability may be the end goal of all improvement work, induced instability as a result of ongoing improvement is the short term goal.

SUB-TOPIC35
----------

The important thing to consider before choosing the right chart is the purpose of the chart. In our experience, run charts are especially useful for determining if improvement is happening when improvement work is ongoing and baseline data are not available. In these situations, the use of control charts may, as mentioned, be inappropriate. In the last section we suggest some guidelines for the use of run charts for improvement work, and a practical example is shown in .

SUB-TOPIC36
----------

Control charts, on the other hand, are especially useful for continuous optimization (reducing variation) and control of processes which already have been brought to acceptable levels of performance. Some types of control charts like CUSUM and EWMA charts are very sensitive to small shifts in process mean over time. These charts are useful for continuous monitoring of critical outcome measures that have been optimized and stabilised in advance in order to detect process degradation as quickly as possible. Mohammed provides several useful examples on the construction and use of control charts in healthcare .

SUB-TOPIC37
----------

For basic Shewhart control charts, we suggest combining the sigma test with the runs and crossings tests using the mean as reference rather than using a fixed limit for longest run, which would be the traditional approach.

SUB-TOPIC38
----------

When using a fixed median, as in our simulation programme, and in the example in , we assume that the median is established from baseline data before any improvement initiative is undertaken. This is, of course, the optimal situation. Baseline data may provide important information on trends and patterns, e.g. autocorrelation, already present in the process, which may be useful in guiding the improvement work .

SUB-TOPIC39
----------

However, getting baseline data beforehand is not always possible in reality. Often improvement programmes are initiated without available baseline data, and waiting for baseline data may even be unethical. In those situations, measurements start together with the improvement initiative. This is not necessarily a problem, as any significant effect will show itself as non-random variation relatively quickly, as demonstrated in the simulation study. Perla provides useful guidance on sampling considerations in ongoing improvement work .

SUB-TOPIC40
----------

In conclusion: This study shows that the use of the shift and crossings rules on run charts is effective for detection of non-random variation due to shifts and drifts in process mean while keeping the false signal rate at an acceptable level. We recommend that the use of the trend rule should be discontinued.

We suggest that orchid bees, in concert with the long tongues and derived feeding modality that enables them to exploit long tubed flowers, have evolved the derived and, in respect to brood provisioning, possibly unique behaviors leading to a higher sugar content of aliments for themselves and their brood, which help to offset the disadvantageous constraints of suction feeding.
